Your position is more advantageous than your enemy's. ~~However, if you're a cool tank driver and are going to bump off the skunks right off their positions, you're going to find lots of interesting surprises scattered all over the map. ~~And another thing. Be careful: We've just got a dispatch about the skunks' new weapon, plasma tank. ~~Hint: Don't let the enemy's machines come right against your tank - this will let you fire on them more effectively. To eliminate their tanks, use the antitank hedgehogs spread over the area."}
